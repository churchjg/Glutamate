# Sentiment React App

## Background

CRUD Application that allows users to ‘save’ memories that have sentimental value. 

## How It Was Done

* Full Stack MERN application (React JS frontend, MongoDB Atlas, NodeJS/Express, Zeet deployment).
* Incorporated React Redux to improve application scalability and speed.
* Implemented Authentication, Google OAuth, and JSON Web Tokens for signing in and signing up.
* Included BCrypt to provide extra security and hash passwords.
